# TaskGenie

## ⚠️ Important Note
This quickly created rough project is currently an in-progress Proof of Concept (POC) and is not intended for production use. It serves as an initial investigation into mixing TypeScript with LLM-generated code. 

Still need to add a bunch of stuff including: orchestration, dynamic api execuation and recursive task calling 

## Description

TaskGenie is an experimental project that explores the integration of TypeScript with code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to create a flexible and extensible system for managing and executing various tasks or "skills" dynamically generated through AI assistance.

## Key Features

- Dynamic skill generation using LLM
- TypeScript-based skill execution
- RESTful API for skill management
- Swagger UI for API documentation and testing

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## API Documentation

After starting the application, you can access the Swagger UI documentation at:

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

This provides an interactive interface to explore and test the API endpoints.

# Task-Genie API Documentation

## Overview

Task-Genie is a REST API that allows users to generate and execute AI-powered skills. This document outlines the key endpoints and their usage.

- **Deployment URL**: https://task-genie.onrender.com/

## Endpoints

### 1. Get All Skills

Retrieves a list of all available skills.

- **URL**: `/skills`
- **Method**: GET
- **Headers**: 
  - Accept: application/json

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://task-genie.onrender.com/skills' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

#### Example Response

```json
[
  {
    "name": "multiplyNumbers",
    "description": "This function takes two numbers as inputs and returns the product of the two numbers.",
    "code": "function multiplyNumbers(num1: number, num2: number): number {\n    return num1 * num2;\n}",
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "num1",
        "type": "number",
        "description": "The first number to multiply"
      },
      {
        "name": "num2",
        "type": "number",
        "description": "The second number to multiply"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "divideNumbers",
    "description": "This function takes two numbers as parameters, divides first number by the second and returns the response.",
    "code": "function divideNumbers(num1: number, num2: number): number | string {\n    if(num2 === 0) {\n       return 'Error: Division by zero';\n    }\n    return num1 / num2;\n}",
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "num1",
        "type": "number",
        "description": "The dividend (number to be divided)"
      },
      {
        "name": "num2",
        "type": "number",
        "description": "The divisor (number to divide by)"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "sayHelloWorld",
    "description": "This function returns the string 'Hello, World!'",
    "code": "function sayHelloWorld(): string {\n    return 'Hello, World!';\n}\n",
    "parameters": []
  }
]
```

### 2. Generate a New Skill

Generates a new skill based on the user's definition.

- **URL**: `/skills/generate` (assumed, not specified in the provided documentation)
- **Method**: POST
- **Headers**: 
  - Accept: application/json
  - Content-Type: application/json

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "description": "A description of the skill you want to generate"
}
```

**Note**: The exact structure of the request body for generating a new skill was not provided in the original documentation. This is an assumed structure and may need to be adjusted based on the actual API implementation.

### 3. Execute a Skill

Executes a specific skill with provided parameters.

- **URL**: `/skills/{skillName}/execute`
- **Method**: POST
- **Headers**: 
  - Accept: application/json
  - Content-Type: application/json

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://task-genie.onrender.com/skills/multiplyNumbers/execute' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "params": [20, 2]
}'
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "result": 40
}
```

## UI Integration

To integrate with a chat-based front end:

1. Use the "Get All Skills" endpoint to populate a list of available skills for the user to choose from.
2. Implement a chat interface where users can input descriptions for new skills.
3. Use the "Generate a New Skill" endpoint to create new skills based on user input.
4. When a user selects a skill to execute, use the "Execute a Skill" endpoint, passing any required parameters.
5. Display the result of the skill execution in the chat interface.

Remember to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback to the user throughout the process.
